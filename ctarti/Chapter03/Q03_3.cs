     * Therefore, in real life, we would likely start a new stack when the previous exceeds 
     * some threshold. Implement a data structure SetOfStacks.Push() and SetOfStacks.pop() 
     * should behave identically to a single stack (that is, pop() should return the same 
     * values as it would if there just a single stack). Follow Up. Implement a function 
     * popAt(int index) which perform a pop operation of a specific sub-stack. */
